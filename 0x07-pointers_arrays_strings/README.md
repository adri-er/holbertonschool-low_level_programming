# Pointers, arrays and strings

With this project I had a closer approach to pointers, arrays and strings in C. I learned what they are and how to use them, the difference between an pointer and an array and how to manipulate strings. As well, what are multidimensional arrays and how to use them. In the next table can be found the files in the repo and a description.

| File name      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| [0-memset.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x07-pointers_arrays_strings/0-memset.c) | Fills memory with a constant byte. |
| [1-memcpy.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x07-pointers_arrays_strings/1-memcpy.c) | Copies memory area. |
| [2-strchr.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x07-pointers_arrays_strings/2-strchr.c) | Locates a character in a string. |
| [3-strspn.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x07-pointers_arrays_strings/3-strspn.c) | Gets the length of a prefix substring. |
| [4-strpbrk.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x07-pointers_arrays_strings/4-strpbrk.c) | Searches a string for any of a set of bytes. |
| [5-strstr.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x07-pointers_arrays_strings/5-strstr.c) | Locates a substring. |
| [7-print_chessboard.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x07-pointers_arrays_strings/7-print_chessboard.c) | Prints the chessboard. |
| [8-print_diagsums.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x07-pointers_arrays_strings/8-print_diagsums.c) | Prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers. |
| [9-set_string.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x07-pointers_arrays_strings/9-set_string.c) | Sets the value of a pointer to a char. |

## Usage ‚öôÔ∏è

For correct compilation:
```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic --std=c89
```

## Built with üõ†Ô∏è

_The whole repository based on low level programming phase of Holberton School foundations is constructed in C and tested in `Ubuntu 14.06.6 LTS`._

# Hello World 

With this project I had the first contact with some C basic features as _processing of a C file to object code, printf and sizeof basic functionalities._ In the next table can be found the files in the repo and a description. 

| File      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| [0-preprocessor](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/0-preprocessor)      | Runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file. |
| [1-compiler](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/1-compiler)   | Compiles a C file but does not link. |
| [2-assembler](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/2-assembler) | Generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file. |
| [3-name](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/3-name) | Compiles a C file and creates an executable named cisfun |
| [4-puts.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/4-puts.c) | Prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line. |
| [5-printf.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/5-printf.c) | Prints exactly with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,, followed by a new line. |
| [6-size.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/6-size.c) | Prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on. |
| [100-intel](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/100-intel) | Script that generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and save it in an output file. |
| [101-quote.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/101-quote.c) | Prints exactly and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19, followed by a new line, to the standard error. |

## Usage ‚öôÔ∏è

For correct compilation:
```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic --std=c89
```


## Built with üõ†Ô∏è

_The whole repository based on low level programming phase of Holberton School foundations is constructed in C_

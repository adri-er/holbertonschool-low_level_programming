# Hello World 

With this project I had the first contact with some C basic features as _processing of a C file to object code, printf and sizeof basic functionalities._ In the next table can be found the files in the repo and a description. 

For more information about the topic, the blog created by the author about this project can be found [‚Ü™Ô∏èhere](https://2903.medium.com/steps-of-compilation-and-gcc-ba71c38972be).

## Usage ‚öôÔ∏è

For correct compilation:
```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic --std=c89
```


## Built with üõ†Ô∏è

_The whole repository based on low level programming phase of Holberton School foundations is constructed in C and tested in `Ubuntu 14.06.6 LTS`._

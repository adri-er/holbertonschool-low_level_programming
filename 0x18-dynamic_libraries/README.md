# Dynamic Libraries

With this project I had the first contact with dynamic libraries in C, how to use and implement them.

For more information about the topic, the blog created by the author about this project can be found [‚Ü™Ô∏èhere](https://2903.medium.com/differences-between-a-static-and-dynamic-library-911d7f2fa175).

| File      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| [libholberton.so]() | Create the dynamic library libholberton.so containing specified functions. |
| [1-create_dynamic_lib.sh]() | Creates a dynamic library called liball.so from all the .c files that are in the current directory. |
| [100-operations.so]() | Create a dynamic library that contains C functions that can be called from Python. |

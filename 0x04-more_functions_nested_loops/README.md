# Functions, nested loops

With this project I had a closer approach to cycles and iterative coding in C. In the next table can be found the files in the repo and a description.

| File name      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| [0-isupper.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/0-isupper.c) | Checks for uppercase character. |
| [1-isdigit.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/1-isdigit.c) | Checks for a digit (0 through 9). |
| [2-mul.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/2-mul.c) | Multiplies two integers. |
| [3-print_numbers.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/3-print_numbers.c) | Prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line. |
| [4-print_most_numbers.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/4-print_most_numbers.c) | Prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line. |
| [5-more_numbers.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/5-more_numbers.c) | Prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line. |
| [6-print_line.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/6-print_line.c) | Draws a straight line in the terminal. |
| [7-print_diagonal.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/7-print_diagonal.c) | Draws a diagonal line on the terminal. |
| [8-print_square.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/8-print_square.c) | Prints a square, followed by a new line. |
| [9-fizz_buzz.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/9-fizz_buzz.c) | Prints the numbers from 1 to 100, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. |
| [10-print_triangle.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/10-print_triangle.c) | Prints a triangle, followed by a new line. |
| [100-prime_factor.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/100-prime_factor.c) | Finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number 612852475143. |
| [101-print_number.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/101-print_number.c) | Prints an integer. |


## Usage ‚öôÔ∏è

For correct compilation:
```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic --std=c89
```


## Built with üõ†Ô∏è

_The whole repository based on low level programming phase of Holberton School foundations is constructed in C and tested in `Ubuntu 14.06.6 LTS`._

# Pointers, arrays and strings

With this project I had my first approach to pointers, arrays and strings in C. I learned what they are and how to use them, the difference between an pointer and an array and how to manipulate strings. In the next table can be found the files in the repo and a description.

| File name      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| [0-strcat.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x06-pointers_arrays_strings/0-strcat.c) | Concatenates two strings. |
| [1-strncat.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x06-pointers_arrays_strings/1-strncat.c) | Concatenates two strings. |
| [2-strncpy.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x06-pointers_arrays_strings/2-strncpy.c) | Copies a string. |
| [3-strcmp.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x06-pointers_arrays_strings/3-strcmp.c) | Compares two strings. |
| [4-rev_array.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x06-pointers_arrays_strings/4-rev_array.c) | Reverses the content of an array of integers. |
| [5-string_toupper.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x06-pointers_arrays_strings/5-string_toupper.c) | Changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase. |
| [6-cap_string.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x06-pointers_arrays_strings/6-cap_string.c) | Capitalizes all words of a string. |
| [7-leet.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x06-pointers_arrays_strings/7-leet.c) | Encodes a string into 1337. |
| [8-rot13.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x06-pointers_arrays_strings/8-rot13.c) | Encodes a string using rot13. |
| [100-print_number.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x06-pointers_arrays_strings/100-print_number.c) | Prints an integer. |
| [101-magic.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x06-pointers_arrays_strings/101-magic.c) | Prints a\[2\] = 98, followed by a new line. |


## Usage ‚öôÔ∏è

For correct compilation:
```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic --std=c89
```

## Built with üõ†Ô∏è

_The whole repository based on low level programming phase of Holberton School foundations is constructed in C and tested in `Ubuntu 14.06.6 LTS`._

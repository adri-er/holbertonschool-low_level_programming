# Functions, nested loops

With this project I had an overview of how to debugg and some manual methods, as well as how to read an error message. In the next table can be found the files in the repo and a description.

| File name      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| [0-main.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x03-debugging/0-main.c) | Test that the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0. |
| [1-main.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x03-debugging/1-main.c) | Comment out the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop. |
| [2-largest_number.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x03-debugging/2-main.c) | Fixed code in 2-largest_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.
 |
| [3-print_remaining_days.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x03-debugging/3-print_remaining_days.c) | Fix the print_remaining_days() function. |

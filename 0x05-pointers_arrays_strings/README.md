# Pointers, arrays and strings

With this project I had my first approach to pointers, arrays and strings in C. I learned what they are and how to use them, the difference between an pointer and an array and how to manipulate strings. In the next table can be found the files in the repo and a description.

| File name      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| [0-reset_to_98.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/0-reset_to_98.c) | Takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98. |
| [1-swap.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/1-swap.c) | Swaps the values of two integers. |
| [2-strlen.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/2-strlen.c) | Returns the length of a string. |
| [3-puts.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/3-puts.c) | Prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout. |
| [4-print_rev.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/4-print_rev.c) | Prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line. |
| [5-rev_string.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/5-rev_string.c) | Reverses a string. |
| [6-puts2.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/6-puts2.c) | Prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line. |
| [7-puts_half.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/7-puts_half.c) | Prints half of a string, followed by a new line. |
| [8-print_array.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/8-print_array.c) | Prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.
| [9-strcpy.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/9-strcpy.c) | Copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to by dest. |

## Usage ‚öôÔ∏è

For correct compilation:
```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic --std=c89
```

## Built with üõ†Ô∏è

_The whole repository based on low level programming phase of Holberton School foundations is constructed in C and tested in `Ubuntu 14.06.6 LTS`._

## Authors ‚úíÔ∏è

This project was developed following the schedule of the foundations program in Holberton.

# Recursion

With this project I had a closer approach to recursive functions, what are they, how to implement them and the appropiate situations to use them. In the next table can be found the files in the repo and a description.

| File name      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| [0-puts_recursion.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x08-recursion/0-puts_recursion.c) | Prints a string, followed by a new line. |
| [1-print_rev_recursion.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x08-recursion/1-print_rev_recursion.c) | Prints a string in reverse. |
| [2-strlen_recursion.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x08-recursion/2-strlen_recursion.c) | Returns the length of a string. |
| [3-factorial.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x08-recursion/3-factorial.c) | Returns the factorial of a given number. |
| [4-pow_recursion.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x08-recursion/4-pow_recursion.c) | Returns the value of x raised to the power of y. |
| [5-sqrt_recursion.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x08-recursion/5-sqrt_recursion.c) | Returns the natural square root of a number. |
| [6-is_prime_number.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x08-recursion/6-is_prime_number.c) | Determines if a number is prime. |
| [7-is_palindrome.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x08-recursion/7-is_palindrome.c) | Determines if a number is a palindrome. |
| [100-wildcmp.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x08-recursion/100-wildcmp.c) | Compares two strings and checks if they are identical, taking into account the wildcard *. |

## Usage ‚öôÔ∏è

For correct compilation:
```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic --std=c89
```

## Built with üõ†Ô∏è

_The whole repository based on low level programming phase of Holberton School foundations is constructed in C and tested in `Ubuntu 14.06.6 LTS`._

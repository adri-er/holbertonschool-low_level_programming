# Variables, if, else, while

With this project I had the first contact with conditionals in C as well with _arithmetic and logical operators, data types, while loops, if and else_ In the next table can be found the files in the repo and a description.

| File name      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| [0-positive_or_negative.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/0-positive_or_negative.c) | Assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. |
| [1-last_digit.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/1-last_digit.c) | Assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. |
| [2-print_alphabet.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/2-print_alphabet.c) | Prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line. |
| [3-print_alphabets.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/3-print_alphabets.c) | Prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line. |
| [4-print_alphabt.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/4-print_alphabt.c) | Prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line. |
| [5-print_numbers.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/5-print_numbers.c) | Prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line. |
| [6-print_numberz.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/6-print_numberz.c) | Prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line. |
| [7-print_tebahpla.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/7-print_tebahpla.c) | Prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line. |
| [8-print_base16.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/8-print_base16.c) | Prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line. |
| [9-print_comb.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/9-print_comb.c) | Prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers. |
| [100-print_comb3.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/100-print_comb3.c) | Prints all possible different combinations of two digits. |
| [101-print_comb4.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/101-print_comb4.c)  | Prints all possible different combinations of three digits. |
| [102-print_comb5.c](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/102-print_comb5.c) | Prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers. |
